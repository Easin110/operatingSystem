# CPU & Memory Management Algorithms in C++

This repository contains implementations of classical CPU scheduling and page replacement algorithms using C++ programming language. It is ideal for Operating Systems students and enthusiasts who want to understand and simulate key OS concepts.

## Included Algorithms:

### CPU Scheduling:
- **FCFS (First Come First Serve)**
- **SJF (Shortest Job First) - Non-preemptive**
- **SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First) - Preemptive SJF**
- **Priority Scheduling - Non-preemptive**
- **Round Robin**

### Disk Scheduling:
- **FCFS Disk Scheduling**
- **SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)**
- **SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)**
- **C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)**

### Page Replacement:
- **FIFO (First In First Out)**
- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**
- **Optimal Page Replacement**

### Deadlock Avoidance:
- **Bankerâ€™s Algorithm**

## Features:
- Simple and clear implementations without advanced STL or external libraries.
- Step-by-step computation of waiting times, turnaround times, and page faults.
- Console output for easy understanding of process sequences and resource management.
- Designed for educational purposes and practice.

## How to Use:
- Each algorithm is implemented in a separate `.cpp` file.
- Compile using any standard C++ compiler, e.g., `g++ filename.cpp -o output`.
- Run the executable to see detailed step-by-step outputs.
